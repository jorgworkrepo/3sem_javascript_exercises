# Guess My Number

The idea of the game is, that you have to try to guess the secret number that is hidden underneath the
question mark. A number between 1 and 20. If the guessed number is wrong, a message should appear in the browser if the number was to low or to
high. If you guesses the number right, the black background color should change to another color and a message should appear
that you guessed right. As a player you should also be able to reset the game, by pressing the button at the top left corner.
You should also try to implement a score and a high-score.

Start by doing the following:

1. open the index.html file with help of VS extension Live Server "Go Live"
2. implement the game in solution.js file
